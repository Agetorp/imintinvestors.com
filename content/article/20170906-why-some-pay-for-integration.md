title: Why Customers Pay for Integration?

So far two (Huawei and one undisclosed chinese company.) of Imints customers have paid for a separete integration project before signing a licensing agreement. We don't know exactly why they do it and not the others but we can always speculate:

I think the reason that some bigger guys are paying for integration projects is that they roll out their own camera software stack. That means both that they do have a _team on their side_ to do the integration work together with and that that team might have very special requirements on the fashion the integration is done so that it fits in with the rest of what they do with the camera.

Having a dedicated team for the camera within the company also probably means that getting Vidhance into a phone model is a _two step decision_ for those customers:

1. Decide to integrate it as one option in their stack. (Decided by the camera team.)
2. Decide to actually include it in the model. (Decided by the product team for the particular model.)

And since they don't wan't to spend their development resources integrating Vidhance into their camera stack without having the _full attention of Imint_ and want to do that before the actual decision to include it in a model is done they end up _paying Imint for the integration_ jobb.

We can assume that they end up _recouping that money later_ through some kind of rebate on licenses. In the Samsung case we know that the licenses for approximate the first years volume was included in the price, as an example.

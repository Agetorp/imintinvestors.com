# Estimated Volumes
The Mate 9 family includes the "Mate 9", "Mate 9 Pro" and "Mate 9 Porsche design". The Mate 9 Family was announced in October 2016, and went on sale in China in November. Availability in most of western Europa, along with the US was not in place until January 2017. Early Mate 9 sales where likely helped by the Samsung Note 7 accident, and 2016 beeing a year where Apple only did smaller updates to it's iPhone.

As we really lack any good data points for how the Mate 8 sold during it's lifetime, it's hard to predict sales for the Mate 9 based on it's predecessor alone. But we know Mate 9 sold at least 5 million units within it's first four months [(source)][M9_4MONTH], and that this was 36% more than the Mate 8, putting the Mate 8 sales at roughly 3.68 million units at the same time in it's life. We also know the Mate 8 sold at least 7 million units during it's first 12 months, but we're not sure exactly when that happened, so I assume it to be in it's 12th month (but it could have been earlier).

We also know that the Mate 9 had sold 8.5 million units within it's 7th month. This seems to put it right "up there" with P9 sales, following quite similar sales volumes as the P9 through it's 4th to 7th months beeing available. The Mate-series probably doesn't usually sell as well as the P-series, so this could seem a bit strange, but when adding in the fact that 2017H1 have seen a 20.6% total volume increase for Huawei smartphones, a new Mate-series selling comparable to last years P-series might not be as unlikely anymore.

Looking at all data we got for all relevant Huawei/Honor phones, monthly unit shipping seems to be very strong (actually near it's peak) around the 7th month after a release. It should be safe to assume Mate 9 is still selling in relative good volumes.

## Conclusion
Based on similarity with P9 in sales volumes so far, the fact that Mate-series is usually outsold by the P-series, but accounting for that 2017 so far have shown a 20.6% unit shipment increase from Huawei, I'm guessing the Mate 9 will sell somwhere in the ballpark of the P9 in it's first 12 months. More specifically _10-12 million units_.
